# WriteStack - Project Summary (Interview Opening)

## Short Version (30 seconds)

WriteStack is a full-stack blogging platform I built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It's a free, open platform where anyone can write or read blogs on any topic—unlike Medium which has paywalls or WordPress which is overly complex. Users can create rich-formatted blogs using CKEditor, engage through likes and comments, get real-time notifications, and save drafts automatically. I also built an admin dashboard with analytics and report generation. Everything from authentication to image uploads is fully functional.

## Slightly Detailed Version (1 minute)

WriteStack is a complete blogging platform I developed with the MERN stack—React on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The goal was to create a free, user-friendly alternative to platforms like Medium or WordPress. Users can write blogs on any topic using a professional rich text editor, organize content by categories, and engage through likes and comments. The platform includes features like auto-save drafts, real-time notifications, search functionality, and an admin dashboard with analytics. I built everything from scratch including authentication with JWT and Google OAuth, image handling with Cloudinary, and a notification system. It's a fully functional platform ready for real users.
